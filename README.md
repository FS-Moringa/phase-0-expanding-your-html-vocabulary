# Expanding Your HTML Vocabulary via MDN

## Learning Goals

- Identify the Mozilla Foundation and MDN
- Navigate the MDN Reference Guide

## Introduction

Because of the pace of change in web technologies, it often feels like as soon
as you learn something it's already obsolete. How can a developer stay
up-to-date? Developers need to be able to reference the latest documentation in
a just-in-time fashion.

When you have a question, you should consult the best source, take
what you need, and use it. The purpose of this README is to help you get
oriented with a popular source of HTML documentation, the [Mozilla Developer
Network [MDN][MDN].

## Identify the Mozilla Foundation and MDN

The Mozilla Foundation is an open-source company that has a long history
with browsers and browser technology.

Mozilla is a reliable reference for the latest HTML tags.  There are many other
sites online that exist to discuss these tags, but when you want a thorough
explanation of a tag, Mozilla is often a great choice.

There are some drawbacks in using MDN.  Because Mozilla is so trusted, their
information tends to be ... _exhaustive_.  Because it's so *ahem* thorough, it
can sometimes be hard to digest.  Their information tends to be for _reference_, not
_tutorial_ purposes.

Drawbacks aside, MDN is a good solid starting place for research and it can
take you from "Does something like this exist?" to "Now I know that this thing
exists, maybe I can find a tutorial!"

## Navigate the MDN Reference Guide

The [MDN HTML Reference Guide][MDN] is a list of HTML tags
grouped together by their functions. These sections are not entirely "human
readable," which makes it a bit difficult to understand where to start looking. 
Some of the headings are very technical-sounding.

To help you find what you need 
in this listing, we've created this helpful table to help you convert between MDN-ese and 
the HTML terms you have learned. We've also listed only the MDN content 
sections that you're most likely to use:

## Conclusion

As developers, we will often feel uncomfortable with the fact that the
technologies we depend on are always growing and changing. With authoritative
guides like [MDN][MDN], we have found out that we can learn just the little bit we
need as we need it.
